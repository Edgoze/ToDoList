# To-Do List

## Description

Implemented a simple To-Do list web app using React as a personal project. I often use To-Do lists for my day-to-day, and I 
wanted to have one customized for myself.  

The web app is organized by 8 containers, each of which is an independent To-Do list (checking off an item/adding an item in 
one of them doesn't affect the others). 

It allows you to add To-Dos, check them off (it removes them from the list), edit a To-Do you're already added, and scroll 
down in a list if you have a lot of entries in it.

## Design evaluation / Things to improve

Some features I would like to add, since they seem like simple things that you would like to do in an app like this, are being able to change the order
of the entries in a list, perhaps by dragging above or below each other. It would also be useful to be able to modify the size of one of the containers,
and even being able to remove/add containers in order to allow it to be more customizable.

## Installation
