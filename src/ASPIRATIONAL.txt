I would have liked to have animations when the components mount, but it's too time-conusming and not that important, so it's
at the bottom of my priority list, and also for some reason I can't install the react-spring library.


DONE:
-Have individual toDos get into editMode rather than the whole day section.
    -Solved by using an array of objects rather than an array of Strings.

-Could we simplify the code? Could we have a single state, a single addFunction, a single...? Tried but wasn't able to. 
I tested (Test.js) an attempt to access arrays inside an array as value for the state, but it didn't work.
    -Solved. No need to have an array with arrays of objects as elements. All we need is to declare a single function for
    each purpose, and give them different inputs depending on the day we are working with.
        -Before this, each day had its own add, toggle, replace... functoins. See App.js

-I tried to have <textbox>s that adapted to the size of their content instead of <input>s of type
text, but I wasn't able to make it work.
    -Solved. Watched good video on automatically resizing <textarea>s, tweaked a little, managed to make it work, and added
    some features.
